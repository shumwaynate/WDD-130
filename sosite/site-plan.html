          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>There are many stereotypes that are rampant in our society concerning individuals that have special needs that can hinder their desire to be outgoing and to try new things. I will be creating  a website that will have helpful information about opportunities for everyone to learn about what the Special Olympics are, when they started and how anyone can sign up to participate as an athlete, volunteer, or a coach for the many events. </p>

          <h3>Audience</h3>
          <p>Our intended audience is for anyone who would be able to participate in the special olympics as a participant or coach. We also intend on reaching people who are unaware of what the special olympics are and how they can help bulid communities.</p>

          <h3>Color Palette</h3>
          <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
      
          <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->

            competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for children and 
            adults with intellectual disabilities, giving them continuing 
            opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, 
            experience joy and participate in a sharing of gifts, skills and 
            friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes and 
            the community.

          <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>

            The Special Olympics mission remains as vital today as it did when 
            the movement was founded in 1968. Special Olympics strives to create
